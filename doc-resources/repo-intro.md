**Deprecation Notice:** With most of the FortifyVulnerabilityExporter functionality now having been integrated into [fcli 2.4.0 and above](https://github.com/fortify/fcli) (see the `fcli ssc action` and `fcli fod action` commands), FortifyVulnerabilityExporter will be deprecated by the end of 2024. Please start migrating any FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-based functionality like pipeline integrations to use fcli instead. If you encounter any fcli limitations that prevent you from migrating, please raise an issue on the [fcli issue tracker](https://github.com/fortify/fcli/issues).
