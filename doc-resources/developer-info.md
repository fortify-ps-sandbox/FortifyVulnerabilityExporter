### Common Commands

All commands listed below use Linux/bash notation; adjust accordingly if you are running on a different platform. All commands are to be executed from the main project directory.

* `./gradlew tasks --all`: List all available tasks
* Build: (plugin binary will be stored in `build/libs`)
	* `./gradlew clean build`: Clean and build the project
	* `./gradlew build`: Build the project without cleaning
	* `./gradlew dist distThirdParty`: Build distribution zip and third-party information bundle
* `./fortify-scan.sh`: Run a Fortify scan; requires Fortify SCA to be installed

### Plugin Development

FortifyVulnerabilityExporter provides a plugin framework that allows for developing custom plugins that extend the functionality of FortifyVulnerabilityExporter. For example, custom plugins can load vulnerability data from some
alternative source, or export vulnerability data to some alternative target.

Instructions for implementing a plugin that can load vulnerability data:

* Provide implementations for the following two interfaces interface defined in `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-api`:
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.api.vuln.loader.IVulnerabilityLoaderFactory`
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.api.vuln.loader.IVulnerabilityLoader`
* Rather than implementing these interfaces directly, implementations usually extend from the following abstract classes defined in `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-spi-from`:
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.spi.source.vuln.loader.AbstractVulnerabilityLoaderFactory<C>`
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.spi.source.vuln.loader.AbstractVulnerabilityLoader`
* The `IVulnerabilityLoaderFactory` implementation class needs to be annotated with Spring's `@Component` annotation
* Implementations may re-use functionality and API's provided in both the `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-spi-from` and 
  `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-api` projects
  
Instructions for implementing a plugin that can export vulnerability data to another system or output format:

* Provide implementations for the following two interfaces interface defined in `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-api`:
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.api.vuln.consumer.IVulnerabilityConsumerFactory`
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.api.vuln.consumer.IVulnerabilityConsumer`
* Rather than implementing these interfaces directly, implementations usually extend from the following abstract classes defined in `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-spi-to`:
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.spi.target.vuln.consumer.AbstractVulnerabilityConsumerFactory<C>`
    * `com.fortify.vulnexport.spi.source.vuln.consumer.AbstractVulnerabilityConsumer`
* The `IVulnerabilityConsumerFactory` implementation class needs to be annotated with Spring's `@Component` annotation
* Implementations may re-use functionality and API's provided in both the `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-spi-to` and 
  `FortifyVulnerabilityExporter-api` projects
  
Plugins may define `compileOnly` dependencies in their `build.gradle` file to reference any dependencies that are
(directly or transitively) defined as `implementation` or `runtimeOnly` dependencies in the main FortifyVulnerabilityExporter `build.gradle` file, for example the various `com.fortify.client.api:common-*` dependencies or `javax.validation:validation-api` dependency. 

Plugins may define `implementation` dependencies in their `build.gradle` file to reference any dependencies that are not available through the main FortifyVulnerabilityExporter `build.gradle` file. Care must be taken that such dependencies (including their transitive dependencies) do not conflict with any of the dependencies already provided by FortifyVulnerabilityExporter.

Plugins are added to the Java classpath using Spring Boot's [PropertyLauncher](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.3/reference/html/appendix-executable-jar-format.html#executable-jar-property-launcher-features) feature.
